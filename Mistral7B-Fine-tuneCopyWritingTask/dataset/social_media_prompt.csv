To all our wonderful customers, a big thank you for supporting us and for loving what we do. 

We’re not going far, our new space is on the corner of Sheep Lane and Andrews Road in Canal Place. It’s literally 4mins from where we are now. 

We have lots of exciting plans for our new space.
We hope to be in there this summer, and will keep you updated, so stay tuned here.

Gather round dear friends, we have an absolute doozy of an announcement to make.

Starting from Monday 4th October we will be pouring Newbarns Pilsner Beer, Table Beer and Pale Ale on a permanent basis on taps 1, 2 and 3!

Our pals down on Jane Street have been a fairly permanent fixture on our draughtlist and in our shop since their inception in 2019 so we figured why not make it official! To celebrate this beautiful new partnership we’ll be pouring their Stout Beer, Oat Lager and West Coast Pils (Burnt Mill collab.) before officially launching the new lines on Monday!

We hope you guys are as excited as we are to have some of the country’s best beers on tap all year round, fresh from the brewery just over a mile down the road.

Hello party people! Hogmanay is upon us and as we’ve had a couple of messages about our event for the big day we figured we’d clear things up here!

Our Hogma-Neigh event is still going ahead as planned, we feel we have taken all necessary precautions for you guys and our Salty Horses to see in the New Year as safely as possible. These precautions are as follows:

- We only sold tickets based on the amount of seats we have so no one stood up drinking and no overcrowding.
- Continued face mask use, you will not be allowed entry to the building without a facemask (or exemption).
- We have rearranged the bar so that all tables will adhere to the new 1m physical distance regulations.
- Table service only across both the Bar and the Shop.

All staff working on the day have been asked to do lateral flow tests before coming in and we would ask if you guys would do the same before the big event.

Okay with the serious stuff out the way, sit tight for a far less regulatory Hogmanay post..."

We opted for their lunch menu which gave us a selection of 8 different meats, from sirloin and rump steak, to minted lamb and chicken thighs 🥩 

Every piece of meat that we had was cooked to perfection, we were especially impressed with the lamb, which melted in your mouth 🤤

In addition to all the meat you could ever ask for, we also had unlimited access to their salad bar. 

As good as the food was, the service was even better. The staff were all extremely friendly, constantly checking that we were enjoying the meal and were so accommodating.

Estabulo is a perfect post-work meal and we would definitely recommend to anyone. We will certainly be returning in the near future.

Thanks again @estabulo_uk"

2021 was a long year for all of us, and it wasn’t always the smoothest ride. 

With lockdown right at the beginning we weren’t able to welcome you through our doors for a big chunk of time. 

And, like for all of our friends in this industry, it was very hard to see our restaurants empty. 

BUT when we finally reopened, boy did you guys make the wait worthwhile✨

We’d like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your continued support, it really does mean the world to us.

From all of us, to all of you, we wish you a very Happy New Year! Here’s to making the most of every moment of this one🥂

 ### Input data:Reservations ### Output:YORK [Gifted / Invite]
📍Estabulo Rodizio Bar & Grill, Vanguarde 

Recently we were very kindly invited to the @estabulo_uk based in Vanguarde, York! ✨

The food was 10/10 and the service was absolutely exceptional! All of our servers were super friendly, attentive and happy to help with anything! A true credit to the York team! 

Included in a set price is unlimited sides and salads from their bar in the middle of the restaurant. We were blown away by how much choice they offered, definitely something for everyone. We particularly enjoyed the garlic mushrooms, pesto pasta and stuffed peppers 😋

@estabulo_uk embraces the traditional Brazilian Gaucho method of cooking. Taking fine cuts of meat, slow cooking in an open fire and serving fresh to your table! We tried a couple from the lunchtime menu: Sirloin steak, rump steak, chicken thighs, gammon and minted lamb (our fave). 

All of the meats were cooked exceptionally well! They were succulent and full of flavour! 

Would highly recommend visiting @estabulo_uk! We will certainly be back to try the dinner menu! 💛 thank you again for having us!"

The class is a Rocket 1 class.  Rocket Yoga is a dynamic and fast pace style of yoga. Born from the Ashtanga series, this adapted style of yoga intends to make the traditional practice more accessible and playful, giving you more choice and encouraging own interpretations of classic asana poses.
The lightheartedness in Rocket makes it an accessible class open to all levels, but that can be made as challenging as you like.

The Rocket 1 series primarily focuses on hip openers, forward bends and core strength - with a few arm balances thrown in.

 ### Input data: ### Output:Every few days we'll profile in more detail one of our class formats. If you haven't been to Strong + Bendy before, or you have but are considering branching out and trying new classes this will let you know what to expect of the class.

Core + Cardio
Class Length: 30 mins or 45 mins
Teachers: Rhi, Jay, Chloe + Katy 
Indoor or outdoor: Always an indoor class 

A class that quickly moves between core and cardio moves with minimum rest. 

A pyramid format where you'll spend 4 minutes working out using equipment (kettlebells, sliders + core balls) 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of abs and 1 minute of press ups. 

Repeated twice through in a 30 minutes class or three times in a 45 mins class 
 
You'll have your own equipment, none will be shared. 
 
The class is challenging, but open to all levels. If you enjoy our outdoor strength class and POP HIIT Pilates you will LOVE this class!

 ### Input data:Notoriety ### Output:Reposting this from Jan last year (2021). London was in Tier 4 and we were able to run outdoor classes, but our indoor studio was shut. 

Someone called the police on us and 2 officers came down to investigate if what we were doing was legit. Thankfully the outcome was that we were within the law- however it was extremely upsetting.

I’m trying to wrap my head around how the police were investigating OUTDOOR gyms at a time when our own government were having parties?? 

We were put under scrutiny when we were just trying to keep our business afloat and provide a service our customers so much needed for their mental health …. yet our own government couldn’t stick to their own rules.

Rushi Sunak has since said that it isn’t ‘justified or proportionate’ to restrict outdoor exercise during Covid….. I TOLD YOU SO 😡

Apologies for the rant- we normally keep our feed a little ray of fitness sunshine, but somethings just can’t go unsaid #fuckboris #sackboris 

(ps yes jessica gave one of the officers a greyhound lean- a greyhounds way of giving out a cuddle- 😂😂😂 She didn’t get the memo they weren’t our friends hahaha)"

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:After hearing the news about the closure of Elite Durham we are quite shocked by the news.

Whilst many gyms have different offerings and approaches and not all agree with one another, the reality is Elite did help people lose weight and strive for a healthier, fitter version of themselves. 

Now whilst some may view this as bad taste, please know that it is not our intention, but, there are numerous small independent gyms in our area (ourselves, transform fitness, boss fitness, flexibility fitness and probably others) who would and could service the requirements of those who’ve signed up for Elite in January and who have lost money doing so as it would now seem. 

Here at RT Fitness we’d like to offer anyone who has been impacted by the closure of elite a weeks free trial and if you feel we’re a suitable option we’ll discount our 3 month sign up too.

If we’re not suitable that’s totally fine of course but please do keep looking to find something suitable, don’t quit, you made the decision to get going… so keep going.  
Drop us a message if you’ve been affected."

 ### Input data:Reservations ### Output:This little lady has totally cracked on. It’s important to remember how much of fitness is about physical and mental health, not just numbers on scales, it’s about loving the body you have and taking care of it, it’s about being able to keep up with the kids on activity days and showing them how to go on…

Here’s a few words from Vicki about her time here with us…

“No time to exercise, cost, etc, all the excuses and the 'I'll start on Monday' that never came... fast forward four months or so and I've achieved everything I'd hoped and things I didn't know would make me feel so much better. 

For me, my focus wasn't really about the weight loss (although there were a few extra pounds kicking about!), but feeling better about myself, physically and mentally, and the biggy, having the energy and fitness to keep up with and enjoy activities with my young family. 

I've found RT supportive, encouraging and realistic on what you can achieve. They regularly point out home truths (in a good way!) coupled with great tips to help keep me on track and accountable. 

They get it. 

They get there are opportunities for excuses, but they understand the dynamics of work / family and help you to strike up a balance so it doesn't become overwhelming.”

Hey myself and Sarah only train x 4 per week 

Because we want the work, family life balance

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:26lbs Down so far 🔥

Check out Ellie! absolute little superstar from our 9.15am crew 

Cracks on, does the work and looks amazing for it...looking FIT 👀

I joined RT Fitness back in August last year after a few years of slowly gaining weight, then lockdown hit and it all went downhill from there. 

I got to the point where I didn’t even recognise myself, not just physically either, my self-esteem was non-existent and I’d totally lost all my confidence.

Jumping into the first few weeks of RT training…yes, my body ached in places I didn’t know I had muscles, but at the same time, meeting  friendly new faces and coaches that encouraged me on the tough days ignited that desire to just keep going . 

Over time I started to notice that I was getting stronger and fitter each week and began celebrating the smalls wins within every session. 

What surprised me most was how quickly my body transformed by following the simple steps in the program. 

The results appeared by literally just doing what was asked of me week in and week out.

Hands down the thing that has meant most to me in the past 6 months is the people at RT.

I remember that first day and how nervous I was, but I quickly realised as soon as you walk through that door you’re part of the gang and I’ve never looked back. 

I’m so grateful to everyone at RT Fitness, I couldn’t have got to this point without your unwavering encouragement, support and downright awesomeness! Thanks guys 😊

 ### Input data:Delivery ### Output:If you're overweight

You MUST change your mindset.

I feel like so many people become slaves to the gym in one respect 

They keep their routines in check, they train daily, they tackle all of their physical issues

But shy away from the underlying issue

Food/Drink and the emotional attachment/relationship

Or the gym becomes their excuse… the reason they can continue to eat too much or drink too much 

The food then becomes a reward for working so hard

The food becomes even more of a comfort because life is still shite and they’re going through enough without taking away the food and drink they enjoy too

They begin to kid themselves that somehow this sport or this gym activity they are doing is justification, they are healthy, they go to the gym

This makes it so much more difficult to let go of damaging and unhealthy habits

We can convince ourselves of literally anything if we tried hard enough

The change in your body must go hand in hand with what’s going on in your head

Sure, you may lose weight, but if you don’t tackle the true issue that led to your obesity in the first place, you will continue to slip back

Take a moment and think about why you’re overweight

What emotions/habits cause you to snack or drink

What behaviours can you realistically change

I then want you to think of ALL the ways being overweight/drinking too much can cause you pain

This moving forward will be your go to 

Instead of thinking of a glass of wine as bliss after a shitty day

That wine will be the reason your liver is slowly but surely giving up 

The reason for that type 2 diabetes you’ve got because you’ve overindulged and not looked after your health 

The reason you may not see your grandkids grow up. 

Hard hitting I know but all true.

As humans we’ve enough to deal with without being the cause of our own pain and suffering and yet we do it on the daily!

A gym membership, even if you attend, means nothing if you still eat/drink shite that keeps you overweight and that eating/drinking shite comes from an emotional/habitual place, much like other habits we form over the years.

You must identify the connection and solve it in your mind… not just your body."

 ### Input data:Reservations ### Output:Whats your excuse? 🤔

Honestly I’ve heard it all when it comes to people either quitting or not starting at all 

The crazy thing is 

You do have an excuse…just you say its something else instead of just saying what you truly mean 

Basically you put more value on something else than you do your health…but still like to bitch about it and blame other factors 

You may not even know it 

So lets see if this is you 
 
“I dont have the money”

Yet your sky bill is £90 per month, you NEEDED the latest iPhone so thats ramped your bill to £80 per month and dont forget that night out once per month which see £150 disappear out of your account 

Meaning you value being in a couch coma watching mindless TV instead of committing to a gym membership 

Oh and that once per month out out of total binge city could of paid for a high quality health program…but instead it served as 4 hours of cocktails and a kebab 

“Look honey another amazon package” 

If health is a priority you will find the money (or stop spending on above) 

And if money is truly a thing..walkings free babes 

“I dont have the time” 

You’re this far down this post already…how many other things have you read today or got sucked into your phone, go on go check your screen time and tell me that you could of easily got in 1 hour walking today 

…oh dont forget those 4 episodes on Netflix you’re going to devour tonight 

More kids classes…you keep complaining about YOU time, but put your kids before your own health…think airplane oxygen situation 

its fine if you can admit it to yourself about using your money and time to do other things than concentrate on your health…

You’ve just got to realise…that you're full of shit

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:‼️ 30lbs Down so far ‼️

Christian started with us, and I remember his first session well too (which he mentions in his write up)

I was a little worried at one point that our lovely red turf was going to be wrecked. 

Sometimes, that initial session is enough to tip people into a ""can't do"" mind-set, it is tough to start when you've not been doing anything for your fitness...

but Christian dug in, every session he came back and pushed himself just that little bit further than the last. 

He gradually worked on his fitness, building it up and up and up and there's no stopping him now. 

He listened to advice, he asked questions when he needed and once again... he remained consistent... there's definitely a theme here 🙂 

Serious hats off to you Christian, you're smashing it!!!

""I honestly have no idea where to begin here so I'll start at the beginning. 

It's May 2021 and I am standing in a queue in Morrisons waiting to be served and out of nowhere, I feel incredibly self-conscious about my body! 

In truth I looked and felt disgusting, but my busting gut and puffy chest had finally caught up with me! 

I stood there, pulling my top away from my chest trying to cover up and an advert from RT popped up on Facebook. 

After filling out a form and a chat with Sarah I was on my way to my first session.

Fast forward 3 months and not only do I look better, but I also feel so much healthier and fitter too (I'll never forget being out of breath by the end of the warm-up and feeling like I was about to throw up at the end of the first session)!

This is solely down to the amazing people at RT Fitness. The workouts can be gruelling to say the least but the relentless motivation and support on hand helps so, so much. 

I've never been able to lose weight easily however here I am, 30lbs down and I can't wait to see where I end up!!

Big thanks to everyone at RT Fitness. 

You have truly changed my life!""

Like our clients we use the weekends...well at least the mornings 😉

To catch up on our steps which we may of missed out on during the week 

Look if you have an office job, working from home etc its hard sometimes to hit your daily requirement 

So try the RT catch up method 

Average of 70,000+ per week rather then then 10,000 per day 

So lets say you only hit 5,000 each working day Mon-Fri 

That gives you 25,000 in the bank 

Meaning you need to make up 45,000 across Saturday and Sunday 

Its roughly 20 miles 

Either break it down into 4x5 mile walks (about 1h 40m each) or x 2 10 mile walks (3h 20m each) 

These may sound long but once you get going you'll love it 

Its just about taking the first action..putting your sneaks on 

We always recommend cracking on as soon as you get up...that way you'll be done and dusted before the rest of the house are awake 

Oh and if you have some friends to tag along, bit banter, good laugh...you'll fly through it 

Enjoy

This fella here is Andy... what a guy he is too.

Ima keep this short and sweet because his write up of his RT Fitness experience tops anything I could write. 17kg (37lbs) in 4 months. Wow.  Another example of consistency and hard work paying off!

Carlsberg don't do gyms...

If the thought of going into a gym surrounded by mirrors and muscle bound adonises, questioning if you even lift, while their muscles twitch involuntarily puts you off joining, this is the place for you.

My first session I was the biggest person in the room, and not in a good way! Everyone was super friendly and supportive, the vibe of the place is like no other gym I've ever been in.

I was surprised by how quickly I noticed changes, by the end of the second week I'd already lost 2kg, I had more energy, I felt generally better in myself. That stiffness in my knee was easing up.

After a month, those trousers that had clearly shrunk in the wash fitted again. After a couple of months that t-shirt I'd stopped wearing because it was too tight felt loser. After three months people at work were starting to comment on my weight loss and all of my shorts and jeans kept falling down.

Now at four months in I'm 17kg down and noticing more muscle. I can see my toes again; I can tie my shoelaces and breathe at the same time (if you know you know). I can get down on the floor and stand back up again without making a litany of noises and needing to pull myself up on something. 

I'm not a morning person, and I'm definitely not a gym person, but I genuinely prefer the mornings I have a gym session than the ones I don't.

Give it a crack, surprise yourself, say hi if you see me""

After three months people at work were starting to comment on my weight loss and all of my shorts and jeans kept falling down.

Now at four months in I'm 17kg down and noticing more muscle. I can see my toes again; I can tie my shoelaces and breathe at the same time (if you know you know). I can get down on the floor and stand back up again without making a litany of noises and needing to pull myself up on something. 

I'm not a morning person, and I'm definitely not a gym person, but I genuinely prefer the mornings I have a gym session than the ones I don't.

Give it a crack, surprise yourself, say hi if you see me""

 ### Input data:Reservations ### Output:‼️43lbs Down so far‼️

This awesome lady from our 16.45 Sunderland squad is another example of consistency 

Ever since we introduced our app last year with our 1:1 weekly nutrition accountability she has checked in each week ensuring she is accountable to the team and most importantly herself 

As you can see she’s doing mint 👀

Absolute top notch crack, always pushing herself and enjoying the sessions 🔥

Heres what she’s got to say: 

I’ve been on the ‘weight loss journey’ for a good 20 years, tried everything and was in the cycle of losing a shit load of weight, feeling good, then putting even more back on. 

Until RT Fitness. 

When I joined, I instantly loved the sessions. Hard work and challenging but what a feel good afterwards! 

It’s a gym for those who don’t like going the bog standard gyms with all the self-esteem issues that go with it, as well as for those, who like me, loved going to the gym but that’s all it was - nothing special, no support and no real challenge or results. 

Until RT Fitness. 

They’ve just bloody got it! They know what they’re doing and it just works! It’s the whole package and completely changes your mindset.

I absolutely love this gym! 

I’ve lost about 3 stone since going all in. 

The accountability keeps me on track, the programs help me make progress, see changes and get fitter and stronger each week. 

Benefits to mental and physical health are second to none. 

I need both the stick and the carrot approach and Ross and Sarah both encourage and kick my arse when needed 😂 

I love the people there, so funny and they push and challenge you just as much as the coaches 😍 

I love being part of the RT team!  Just fkn awesome all round! #getyourfknstepsin

 ### Input data:Reservations ### Output:What you get with RT Fitness 👊🏻

When we use the term “fully coached” this is what we mean 

✅ x 4 sessions per week at your chosen time slot 

Literally all you have to do is turn up…we take care of the rest, 

No booking on Sunday night hoping to get in

No setting up equipment 

You come in and the coach takes you through everything in 45 mins 

Think of it as a 1:1 but in a group setting 

Your time slot is your time slot keeping you your super tight schedule in place 

Oh and you get to train with he same faces day in day out all on the same journey as you…think of these people as the most reliable training partners you can have 

✅ 1:1 nutrition guidance 

As you may know we run a zero BS nutrition protocol 

No starvation diets 

No trendy BS 

No shake diet 

No dangerously low calories 

No cooky cutter meal plans 

Just calorie and macronutrient goals all set up for you 

We have some serious knowledge and education behind the team, so if you ever need to question anything we can explain fully…not just say “follow the plan”

When you’re a part of the RT team you get 1:1 access with our nutritionist each and every week, you get a notification each week for accountably 

So whatever data we get we can adjust and continue to get you the results you desire personally 

✅ Monthly challenges 

We put in place a monthly challenge to see how far your fitness levels have come along…cos you see its not always about weight loss, we want you to focus on fitness goals as well 

Who doesn’t want to be fitter than the kids?

I could go on and on 💪🏻 😁

If you just want a gym where you walk in, do a bit of this and a bit of that with no accountability or guidance, turning up when you feel like it.. then we aren’t for you 

If you’re looking for a fully coached program with full accountability to get fast kick ass RESULTS then drop us a message

Now she's come back with a bang!!! 

Kim's attitude to training and nutrition has been spot on throughout regardless of any obstacles in her way and I think you'll agree she's done an awesome job.

""I'm so glad I re-joined RT Fitness after having to take time out for health reasons. It's not like other gyms. 

The sessions are set routines which change regularly to keep challenging you and keep you motivated. 

The coaches are great too and make sure you are doing things right and pushing yourself. Everyone is so friendly, and the weekly accountability and feedback is great too. So happy to be back x""

You know that saying... ""Hard Work Pays Off""?!

How about a picture representation of just that...

Michael works hard but he has a good time in the process. 

He hasn't put his life on hold for his results neither, still enjoying time out, a drink (or several), he's got the balance right. 

Michael always brings a smile into the gym, absolutely tortures Ross about not getting enough steps in to beat him on our steps table (which I think I love him most for ha) and he grafts every session. 

Let's hear from the man himself about his experience here at RT and show him some love.

""Hard work, determination and killer workouts! 

I can't thank the RT Fitness guys enough for pushing me towards my goals in every session, from the unhealthiest I have been in my life to without a doubt the fittest and happiest I have been! 

There’s been days when I didn’t want to turn up and days where the sessions were the highlight of my day! After a really strange all be it lazy lockdown this was exactly the kick up my arse I needed to get back into fitness and it’s the best decision I have made to date!""

 ### Input data: ### Output:Nearly 2 stone (28lbs) down in 90 Days 😱

Check out Davids initial 90 Day journey with RT Fitness 

I'm David, 37 years old and in my mind I've been on the chunky side for the majority of them.

About 6/7 years ago I was at my heaviest, approaching 20 stone. 

I joined the gym and did manage to lose a bit of weight, nearly 3 stone. 

The problem was I got bored and didn’t go one day which led to another and another and another and so the weight piled on again, before I knew it I was back to 18 stone!! 

and…….. yeah I paid for a gym membership that never got used.

I have a family history of heart disease and diabetes and have myself suffered from high blood pressure and cholesterol. 

Having a wife and 3 kids myself, it was time to act!!

I'd seen RT fitness on Facebook loads of times and a couple of times I did look into it further but then at the final hurdle I always bottled it!!. 

I can't do that! It's not my thing! 

What if it's full of fitness fanatic's etc..etc..etc……

Then after a gentle nudge from my wife Joanna, I contacted Sarah and Ross for some more info.

A week later I was sat outside of RT Fitness at 6 am on a Monday morning shitting bricks!!

In reality there was nothing to worry about, I was made welcome from the off and quickly got talking to plenty of other people, people all there for the same reason, people who had probably sat outside thinking the same as me.

Not going to lie after that first session, I had muscle pain in muscles I didn’t realise I had, this quickly subsided and I soon got to grips with 4 sessions a week, tracking my food and actually looking forward to prowler Fridays!!

I'm coming to the end of my initial 90 day program I have lost nearly 2 stone but more importantly my fitness has vastly improved. I'm still only halfway to where I want to be but thanks to RT fitness I'm more than confident I'll get there.

You ever hear yourself saying…”but I do really well during the week”

Yes the easiest thing to do on a weekend is mong out and get pissed 

Meaning you burn less cals but consume more cals than you normally would 

Putting you in a HUGE caloric surplus = weight gain 

Hence why you NEVER change 

Lose 2lbs by Friday put 2lbs back on come Monday 

Being good during the week, but then being a sloth on the weekend puts you straight back to a maintenance 

Then having to start all over again each and every week 

Look…if you truly want to lose weight, get in shape or be a bit healthier 

Then you do have to do this shit on a weekend 

Plan your food 

Hey if you want a takeaway…factor it in, order a bit less and only do it once 

Get active…like we tell our clients, the first thing you should do on a Saturday and Sunday is whack your trainers on and go for a walk 

A 3 mile walk takes a bit less than an hour and burns 500cals which is around 6500 steps 

With the little bit of pottering around the house then you’ll easy make up 10,000 

BUT…if you want to indulge or know your heading for an all night “out out” then double those steps to counter balance all the glutenous later on 

The weekends STILL count so make em count

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:No gym this weekend?…no problem 😃

We love to get our clients active outside of the gym 

Its these key element which increase their results faster ⚖️

Look if you sit on your arse most of the time and only go to the gym x 3 per week you really won’t make much progress 🤔

Quick maths…the only change you make is going to the gym x 3 with your current lifestyle, you may only burn 350cals within those session extra to what you burn now 

So over a week 1150 extra cals burned 

Its takes 3500cals burned to lose a 1lb 

That means its gonna take you over 3 weeks to burn 1lb without changing your diet or upping your activity levels outside of session 🙁

One of the main RT Fitness habits is getting your steps in 🚶‍♂️

Hey we’ve even set the crew a 10 mile +walking challenge this month to keep them on point 

So if no gym this weekend heres what you do 

Wake up, put trainers on, open front door and don’t come back till you hit 15,000 steps or if you dont have a steps tracker 6.5 mile walk which = roughly 1200cals burned 

Enjoy 😉

Oh and if you're truly ready to make significant changes to your physique and mindset then drop us a message for details on our 90 Day Total Transformation program 🔥

 ### Input data: ### Output:4 FREE top tips to NOT gain weight over Xmas 🎅🏻

Winter is well and truly here and I want to give you some top tips to NOT start 2022 heavier than you are now 

So you may not of started training...no biggy 

There are ways around this to keep the weight at bay 

1. GET WALKING 

Yeah you and all of our clients have heard us bang on about this for years…but its such a HUGE underestimated tool which everyone has 

A 1 hour walk = 6500 daily steps = 500cals burned 

You get into this habit each and everyday you’ll feel great mentally and physically…the benefits are endless 

And the best part its FREE 

2. STOP BUYING SHITE 

I cant tell you how many times I tell his one to people 

But if its not in the house then you won’t consume it 

Create as much friction as possible between you and high caloric foods 

I’ve seen all the celebration tubs on half offer…but thats why they do it so you eat and now and have to buy more near xmas 

I’ll also guarantee that someone will buy you some anyways…so just hold out till then if you really want some 

3. DONT BUY THE HALF PRICE BOOZE 

Yep same as above if its in the house…you’ll have it 

4. WEIGH YOURSELF DAILY 

You want some real shock factor in your life?

Then theres no burying your head in the sand when it comes to see the numbers on the scales 

If you see you weight creeping up you better put down that 2nd pack of mince pies pet 

It may seem extreme…but whats more extreme 

Weighing yourself daily or putting on 10lbs without you wanting to know?

Follow the advice above and you will get through this 

Hey non if it actually costs you anything…infant it saves you money 

Like I say every year if you can come into the new year the same weight as you do the 1st of December you’re a winner 

So take action now 

Hope this helps

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:When will you be ready? 🤔

Its crazy 

You know you’ve put on weight 

Countless diets 

Countless programs 

& still…

The same weight if not bigger 

Its mental how we just fall into old habits EVERY time we try to do something 

Then BOOM!

It comes to a point when it CLICKS 

Dave didn’t start until he was 46 has now been with us 4 years, hes
stronger & leaner than ever 

Deb didn’t start her journey until she was 53…3 years still with us & has kept off 4 stone 

Nikki started at 40…2 years later, 6 stone down & keeping it off 

(please dont hate me if I got your ages wrong 🤪)

Then theres my Dad 61 

He does train at our unit but just cracks on by himself 

Ive seen his weight go up and down for years and you can see that its finally clicked for him 

No going back, no pointless snacking & hardly a take away in sight 

Like the above clients he FINALLY made that click 

And he’s dropped 4 stone this year 

Love seeing the work he’s put in

I see many people walk through our doors who won’t be ready until a health scare or 
someone they know dies through obesity related issues 

BUT by then…its usually too late 

All of the above people have all said this very line 

“I wish I started sooner” 

How many times have we said that about things ^^^

If you take a good long hard look at yourself in the mirror and say 

I’m serious, actually go look in a mirror and ask yourself the questions below 

“Am I the healthiest version of myself?”

“Do I need to lose weight not just for me but for my family”

“Is my current diet and lifestyle killing me slowly”

“Am I a role model for the people around me” 

Not next year 

Not put it off again 

Not fuck off a program or diet 1-2 weeks in 

This time you’ll actually put the effort in and become the healthiest version of yourself 

So…just do what you said you where gonna do

Here’s what Paula had to say: I turned 50 and weighed over 13 stone 9lbs  and was a size 20/22. I’m 5’2” and have a genetic condition hEDS (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome- Hypermobility). I was very unwell and then diagnosed Diabetic, having to take a lot of medication

It was the kick start I needed to change my life around. I couldn’t have done it without my Husbands support and encouragement ( He has lost an amazing  4 stone !) We cut out all unhealthy food, sweets, crisps, cakes, chocolate, chips, and swopped to whole grain bread and pasta and rice. Cut our portion sizes down and filled up on vegetables. We eat meat, fish, vegetables and salads. Out have gone the ready meals!

I used to do little or no exercise! Hubby bought us mountain bikes which we enjoy, doing about 15 miles each outing. We walk miles.. Then I joined Bannatynes’s and found I really enjoyed the Aqua classes with Dan and Aston and Alarna.. also Alarna worked with me to use the gym exercise equipment especially tailored for my joint condition and now I’m a size 10/12 and about 10 stone 3lbs. More importantly my Diabetes is now under control. 

A huge well done to Paula, this is so inspiring!!✨"

Late last year we decided to move our academy⁣

The goal was simple: ⁣
💥 Massively upgrade our facilities ⁣
💥 More central location⁣
⁣
⁣
Lockdowns were still an extremely real threat and so the risk was massive. ⁣
⁣
⁣
But there is no growth without risk⁣
⁣
⁣
The perfect space had become available on Boucher Road and I knew I could make something amazing there. ⁣
⁣
⁣
And so we committed. 100% committed. And we haven’t looked back since. ⁣

COMMITMENT- this is often what people are not willing to do. We all want the results. But taking risks and committing are so often avoided. ⁣

⁣
I have never been one to just dip my toe in the water. Why?? Because it simply doesn’t work. There will always be a million reasons not to do something or things that make it difficult. ⁣
⁣
⁣
The only question that matters is: Do I really want this? If the answer is yes, then it must become a priority. YOU WILL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK. ⁣
⁣
⁣
Yes, sacrifices will need to be made. But the sacrifices I have made have usually been things that weren’t important anyway!!⁣

Thank you to everybody who helped to get this off the ground. Your help made all the difference. We now have this amazing space in the perfect location for our community to continue to grow. ⁣

Before people begin Brazilian Jiu Jitsu they have preconceived ideas of what it is. ⁣
⁣
⁣
I’ve done this for a long time…. And for me, these 3 pictures really sum it up for my team. ⁣
⁣
⁣
1. Effort, progress and reward. ⁣
Time spent training on the mats takes effort and dedication. But through this we learn self-discipline, and we get to enjoy all of the skills, fitness, confidence, and everything else Jiu Jitsu gives to you once you commit to it ⁣
⁣
⁣
2. Teamwork, bonding & camaraderie ⁣
After a tough training session, you know you’ve shared time with like minded people and helped them progress, just like they’ve helped you. There has yet to be a session where there aren’t laughs and joking around, regardless of how experienced you are. Only those who are willing to push themselves ever know this feeling but it’s one that lasts for days - regardless of what else is going on in your life off the mats. ⁣
⁣
⁣
The preconceived ideas of training a martial art like BJJ are sometimes what keep people away. But the only way to truly know and reap all of the rewards are to leave that comfort zone behind that’s holding you back. ⁣
⁣
⁣
💢We have adult spaces available today in our beginners programmes for our Boucher Road academy. ⁣
⁣
We’ve helped hundreds of people get started in BJJ and enjoy all of the rewards - grab a space today and exceed even your own expectations of what you can achieve ⁣
⁣
See you on the mats ⁣

Why is it difficult to maintain that drive and focus in February that you began the year with??⁣
⁣
⁣
People confuse ‘motivation’ with ‘discipline’⁣
⁣
⁣
When you first begin something, it’s not in your normal routine, so it takes planning and effort with every session. The initial excitement of starting helps though. ⁣
⁣
⁣
The key to making something a permanent feature in your life is to get over the initial hump… and make it your ROUTINE!! Make it something that you do regularly and without question. ⁣
⁣
⁣
And this is why February sucks! The initial excitement is over … the weather is cold and dark, and you’ve overspent at Xmas!⁣

But now is the time to find DISCIPLINE. Remember WHY you started and how difficult is was to build the courage to begin. ⁣
⁣
⁣
People who make it through February have massively increased their success rate. This means you’ve found routine, discipline, and are on the way to making real progress that lasts a lifetime. ⁣
⁣
⁣
So, if you’re struggling to keep going at the minute, then know that you’re not alone, but keep pushing forwards. Always forwards and never back. ⁣

See you on the mats ⁣

For fitness⁣
Confidence⁣
Self defence ⁣
To Socialise⁣
⁣
👉 But the one thing that almost everybody says is: TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW⁣

We all want to feel like we’re making progress, especially when normal day to day life can make you feel like you’re stuck on the hamster wheel just going round and round…. Groundhog Day!!⁣
⁣
⁣
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gives you progress!! Yes, we move up the belts and get the visible progress…⁣
⁣
⁣
…But it’s the details that have people coming back for more as they learn things on a deeper level⁣
⁣
⁣
You cannot learn this overnight. And that’s what is so rewarding. Even when you feel like you know something, there are always more details to add…. The study never ends. ⁣
⁣
⁣
To continue to learn new things and make progress is essential as an adult for our mental health…. We weren’t designed to be stuck in a rut our entire working life!!⁣

Last night our Foundations programme learned how to escape from a pin on the ground - this is never a good position to be in,  whether it’s in Jiu Jitsu or a self defence scenario ⁣
⁣
⁣
But with the right technique and time to practice for real, our team are developing the skills and confidence to never fear this and know how to get back to safety, and even reverse the position. ⁣
⁣
⁣
Another sweaty night ! 😀. Well done guys"

How do we get our kids to go from quiet to confident??⁣
⁣
⁣
It isn’t about trying to make our kids the toughest and loudest people in the room. But it is important we help them overcome shyness that can and will hold them back in life. ⁣
⁣
⁣
Our kids programme uses the latest methods of working with these age groups to help kids find their own potential and begin to see the fun they can have when they feel confident. ⁣
⁣
⁣
Every game they play, chats from their coaches, interaction with each other, and task they are set in class are designed to help the kids discover their own voice and confidence, no matter what environment they’re in. ⁣
⁣
⁣
Each success they have, and reward they receive for getting out of their comfort zones gives them yet another boost to keep pushing themselves. Leaving shyness and fear of the unknown a long way behind them. ⁣
⁣

Well done to all of our Icon Jiu Jitsu kids - every session is another foundation built for a confident future 🔥🔥🔥"

Two things that are critical to child’s development and their will to learn. ⁣
⁣
✅ Personal challenge - our children's programme builds their confidence and willingness to get outside of their comfort zones. We achieve this by allowing them to be challenged in win/lose scenarios, and learn how to cope with either outcome. The kids soon learn that the challenge itself was the rewarding part, teaching them to seek out challenge in any situation, and never to fear the unknown. ⁣
⁣
⁣
✅ Fun - kids love to play.  It’s what keeps them coming back for more!! Through games we can keep them super active and learn about integrity, teamwork, and just to enjoy what they do. ⁣

It’s all of this that gives me the enthusiasm I feel today - helping people develop and watching them smash through their own comfort zones has made every day on the mats a good day. ⁣

Swimming, Wrestling (in the water too and on land) , Rowing, Skiing, Ice Skating, Hunting, heavy stone lifting and of course constantly training with weapons. Contemporary historians suggest that heavier than normal weaponry was used in practice.
Agility and dexterity were greatly admired ( juggling weapons, oar walking)
What we can be sure of is that Vikings did not train for aesthetics!!! The actor above probably did though!!

We took the best of what we did then.. Closely coached, group training and moved away from the passive aggressive competitive vibe and doing everything as quickly as possible.
Added some diverse, fun equipment and added more variety to tempo and plane of movement! It's definitely a winning formula! 

I personally got a lot of benefit from group training, as it pushes you on and keeps you accountable.

If you have access to a rope and the necessary skills.. Try this workout⬇️⬇️

In 5 minutes climb the rope as many times as possible/ stay off the ground as long as possible. Everytime you come off equals 10 Burpees. Keep the hammer down, stay off the ground as long as possible. Keep the rest after the burpees as short as possible.. Keep intensity high!!

From thatday I was out everytime there was surf and even paddled my board when it was flat.

 Within 2 years of learning, I was surfing Puerto Escondido, one of the heaviest waves in the world and had had a two wave hold down in Guatemala that nearly ended my days.

After about 3 months I got back to the UK, saved, spent the Autumn season in France, saved again and flew one way to Brazil!! Spent 8 years surfing and living hand to mouth in a blissful zen state of having nothing but having everything!!

If you want anything, you've got to pack up, sack up and put it out there!! But wave goodbye to your comfort zone first :) It's the most Viking thing you can do in this modern age.. Find your Heart of Darkness!

 ### Input data:Notoriety ### Output:I was addicted to training, no doubt! 15000m Swimming per week, 300miles cycling and 100 miles running.. All at high intensity... my normal running speed was  about 5.20 per mile.. That isn't even including gymwork!! I ran a gym on the seafront and would knock out 10k on the Rower just to pass the time, active rest😂😂
I won a couple of races but injured my knee doing a horrendous marathon across the South Downs midwinter and in the recovery process took up surfing and became obsessed by that instead!! Never been into parttiming something, it is all or nothing!!

 ### Input data:Notoriety ### Output:10 years ago, at the age of 45 I could still do all the good stuff... Gymnastic tricks like this, freestanding headstand to Handstand, strict muscle ups and one arm Arabsprings to name a few...
I could still consistently run 1 mile under 6 minutes too..
Lifting wise, I could Squat Clean my bodyweight, push press my bodyweight, do 6 reps of Bench at bodyweight and deadlift just shy of 2 x bodyweight.. None amazing but taken as a whole with the others not bad. I could also still surf as well as I did back in the 90s..

Fast forward 10 years and years of hammering my body have definitely taken their toll! I can no longer run.. at all..... nor can I stand up surf anymore!
Training 7 hours a day in my 20s and not taking care of recovery and healing prevent me from doing the two activities I love the most!
I definitely lived my 20s and 30s hammer down!! 

This is not a post to evoke sympathy, though I am ill and probably feel a bit sorry for myself😂😂. It is more to raise awareness of not overtraining (I see it all the time, despite my advise)
It is also about perservering, adapting, getting by and making the most of what you have.
Remember the past, live in the moment and plan for the future. It applies to all aspects of your life if you think about it.

When I first ran a gym in the late 80s there were no fitness specific qualifications or even a fitness industry.

When I opened first CrossFit East Lothian then CrossFit Edinburgh there were about two other gyms in Edinburgh offering group strength and Conditioning/ functional fitness.. Now they are everywhere!!!

In that time I have trained everyone from complete beginners to professional/elite athletes, CrossFit HQ came over and made two short films about us and several ex members have gone on to specialise and become top level powerlifters and Olympic lifters. 🏋️... One of my first PT clients even opened an outdoor gym near Dunbar!!! 

The Viking Training System™ is different to what we used to offer, no hyper competitive members checking other people's scores or shaving off a few reps to save face and a much more personalised approach to programming, utilising more planes of movement, tempos and more esoteric equipment.

If you have hobbies that you enjoy, why bother spending time on Strength and Conditioning?

And if you do supplementary work, why not just train at home?

Even if you are doing an activity such as martial arts, surfing or.. cycling... 4 times a week you will need to do some relevant supplementary work to avoid over use injuries, build a strength base, iron out any muscular imbalances your hobby may produce and make sure you have a full range of movement!

➡️To train safely and effectively requires a coach with relevant experience and qualifications to help you make the most of your time. A place like The Viking Training System also offers a supportive and friendly environment, a comfortable, pretence free zone.⬅️

Of course, improving your health and wellbeing can be a goal itself. Just having a guided focus after a busy day can help not only your physical wellbeing but your mental health too.

Guidance, support and companionship.. It is what we stand for at The Viking Training System™

No amount of yoga, surfskating or increasing your absolute strength will compensate for a lack of environmental knowledge!

While we are at it, stop using the training of elite level, highly paid professional surfers who have been at the beach everyday since they wore nappies as some sort of reference point, it isn't!!

To all members and followers! Sorry for the lack of activity and updates on current status as we’ve been extra busy behind the scenes!

The gym will continue to operate as normal as we work behind the scenes. We will let you all know when we will have to close for a maximum 48 hours to transfer all machines and weights to the new gym, and you’ll continue in a brand new bright setting with Redditch’s original and Mecca weights and fitness gym. We can’t wait to complete a swift and disruption free move and welcome you all to a new chapter!! 
Keep training and get your last memories of Fitness Unlimited at millsborough house and ready to start brand new ones with us in the new building 💪"

 ### Input data:Reservations ### Output:Many thanks for all your feedback! 😊 

It’s been so lovely to hear all your positive comments about Cheeky Chops Play Café but it’s also been incredibly useful to hear your constructive feedback regarding tweaks that we could make to improve our customer experience. We knew we wouldn’t get everything 100% right the first time of asking and it’s been fantastic to hear your suggestions.

As a result, we’ve made several alterations with three of these highlighted below:

1) We have merged our two middle sessions from Monday-Friday into one extended “open play session”. It will run between 11.30am-3pm and will appear as “11.30” on the booking page of our website but you can arrive at any time during that 3.5 hour time-period and stay for 90mins. Of course, you can always simply turn-up without making a booking. 

We have done this because some customers commented that the previous fixed-time sessions clashed with other commitments such as nursery pick-up and/or naps so hopefully this will allow more flexibility.

The timings of the first and last sessions of the day will remain the same.

2) We have added more adult soft drinks to our menu. We now offer Coke, Diet Coke and Appletiser to go with our other soft and alcoholic drinks. 🥤 🍻 🍷 

3) It has been suggested that we should offer some more child-friendly cake flavours so we have added rainbow cake to our range. Have a slice next time you’re in - it’s delicious!!! 🍰 😋

 ### Input data:Theme days ### Output:At Cheeky Chops, one of our core values is Community and we know how important it is for parents and care givers to form local networks.

As of this coming Tuesday (30th November), we would like to introduce “Chatty Tuesday” to the last session of the day, which runs from 3.30-5pm.

The idea is based around local parents and care givers getting to know one another. It will be just like any normal play session at Cheeky Chops but we would like to encourage customers to get to know one another during the 90 minutes.

Whether you are new to the area or you simply want to expand your local mummy and daddy network, please come along and join us. Please feel free to come as an individual or as a group but make sure that you’re willing to chat to others during the session 😊

Today we have @15pawelekk demonstrating the GOOD and BAD form of RDLs ⬇️ 

1st - The Bad form ❌
❌ Back completely rounded
❌ Neck not in alignment with the spin
❌ Core disengaged
❌ Inappropriate weight (too heavy) compromising the ability to lift the weight appropriately 
❌ Overthrusting the hips on the top of the movement 

2nd - The Good Form ✅
✅ Choose appropriate weight for YOU 
✅Engage core and lats 
✅ Straighten your back and keep neck in alignment with back
✅Pull the bar close to your shins and lift by driving your feet in the floor 
✅ Hinging at your hips - No hyperextending hips
✅ Avoid hyperextending your knees - create a slight bend to minimise unnecessary stress on lower back and joints 

These are the most common mistakes we see in the gym on a daily basis so I hope you take some time out to watch and read this to help you out! 

Any other videos you would like to see, just let us know down below! 💪🏼

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:THROWBACK TO 8 YEARS AGO!

When we first opened our doors this is how our facility looked.  We had 3 rowing machines, a dodgy bike, one box, a handful of barbells, kettlebells & weights.  The rig hadn't even arrived, the mats were still needing to be finished off and our upstairs venue was still a building site.  It certainly wasn't a perfect opening but with bags of enthusiasm, great support and a never failing quest for improvement we opened nonetheless.

8 years on we have stood the test of time, (even with the major uncertainty of the last year). If you swipe to the left this is our facility today.  Pretty much every area of the facility that we can expand has been expanded and our kit much improved over time.  We operate with the same levels of enthusiasm and passion for what we do because we simply love what we do. 

Thankyou to everyone who has been a part of our last 8 years whether that has been coming to a single class, being lifetime members or anything in between.  Whether you have supported us near or afar we appreciate you.

You don't have to have perfection to get started, don't wait until everything lines up to get going with your dreams.  Start now.  Progress comes with every step forward and often propels when you are pulled back too. 

Here is to the next 8 years!  Whatever they may bring.

Jackie was an integral part of The Box Portsmouth team from the day we opened (and long before) right up until the time when she fell ill.  She is deeply missed and will be forever with us in our hearts.

The workout is made up of the benchmark hero Wod Jackie followed by movements to celebrate her birth day 22/09/1965 ending with 55 burpees. 55 being her age when she sadly lost her fight with cancer. 

Non-members as well as members are invited to come along to complete the workout at 10am. Workout donations will be put towards St Rowans Hospice where Jackie received her end of life care. 

Please share 💕

The purpose of this workshop is to gain a better understanding of female hormones. For those of us who have female hormones, learning to sync our cycle with work and life is the ultimate bio-hack that can help harness energy, productivity and optimise the chance of success. For those of us who don't, this talk is still as relevant as it helps understand those we work with, live with and interact with everyday of our lives. We look at what is the female cycle, the main hormones involved, how to use them to our advantage, how we can tailor our exercise, nutrition and lifestyle towards them, how to track our cycles and also how our cycles change throughout life. This workshop is designed to be as interactive as possible and will be finished with a 15min Q&A so attendees can get as much as possible from the session.

The workshop is included in your membership if you’re doing the challenge. Send us a DM To redeem your discount code.

My style of teaching is to push someone to their  limits, not only physically but to a mental state of strength. I love to see people rip into their training to unleash those endorphins, so I’ll be right by your side with words of encouragement.”

Taught by a BBOdance registered teacher this general level class is suitable for anyone with some knowledge of ballet wishing to improve their ballet technique.

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:Classes are back next week with a limited timetable. Small socially distanced classes - £8 members and £10 non-members. Toby’s classes next week:

Reps - 6pm Monday - Increase your strength and stamina with this 60-minute strength training cardio workout using a Barbell, a Step Bench and Dumbbells. You will be completing high reps with light weights which will allow you to focus primarily on the muscle group you are working on. Work hard enough and you will continue burning calories after you've completed the workout due to the boost that resistance training gives your metabolism.

Weighted Workout - 6pm Wednesday - Because your muscles are held under tension for a longer time period - using a slow cadence - more muscle fibres have to be recruited to maintain that tension and as a result, the muscles receive more stimulation. This workout will help increase your energy expenditure, so you will also get a little extra calorie burn.

Core Stability - 9am Thursday - This 60 minute workout incorporates posterior chain mat-based exercises. It is a movement practice designed to teach you how to naturally restore and affectively recruit core muscle strength, balance and flexibility to enhance performance and reduce pain. The anatomical term posterior refers to the backside of the body specifically the lower back, gluteal, hamstrings and calf muscles."

Here at 𝐇𝐘𝐁 we heat our studio to 40° using state of the art Infrared heating panels. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
One of the benefits of infrared heat therapy is that is gently heats your muscles and joints directly instead of heating the air around you. ⁣
⁣
This creates a more comfortable atmosphere that doesn’t dry or irritate your skin - in fact your skin will be glowing after! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This along with our high humidity levels and air flow allow for optimal breathing while you’re in the room - it’s not like a dry sauna or a steam room, don’t worry.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Thanks to the infrared you will be drenched by the end ! 𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝 - 𝐬𝐨, 𝐬𝐨 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝. Sweating allows you to flush your system of toxins and free radicals, reducing bloating, water retention and blockages. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
On a deeper level there are 𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥, 𝐩𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 responses to heat therapy which are greatly beneficial to your nervous system, mental health and well-being. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Heat therapy creates heat stress which when combined with a 60 minute physical yoga class trains us in distress tolerance. This is where you 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞 and learn to breathe through  it instead of react.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐱𝐞𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐰𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐝𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝 - instead of jumping into a state of flight or fight, your nervous system - over time and with gentle practise - can learn to differentiate between real and imagined threat or danger.

You learn to find comfort in the discomfort. ⁣⁣
You learn to use your breath to slow down your heart rate and calm your nervous system. ⁣⁣
You learn emotional regulation.

Our 𝐇𝐘𝐁 teachers have all been practising for around a decade too. So when we say - ‘ if you don’t get it today, take a break and come back tomorrow ‘ we mean it. ⁣
⁣
This practise could be with you for the 
rest of your life, so what’s the rush. 🤠

Showing up to class is sometimes more than enough. You don’t have to give 110% every class - listen to your body, rest, breathe and know there is always tomorrow. ⁣
⁣
When you listen to what your body needs and rest, you can actually enjoy yourself and get the most out of your practise. ⁣
⁣
Then every class you’ll leave feeling like you’ve⁣
accomplished something, because you have! ⁣

⁣
When you enjoy your practise and feel good you create 𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 that encourage you to come back time and time again. ⁣
⁣
Then your practise becomes sustainable. ⁣
Then you become a regular. ⁣

 Every Hot Yoga class here is heated by 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 heaters to a toasty 40 degrees. Here are just some of the many benefits to practising in a Infrared heated studio …

⁣🔅Our state of the art #Infrared heating system directly warms muscles, allowing for a greater range of motion. 

This improves flexibility as well as aiding recovery and rehabilitation. ⁣
⁣
🔅The human body has an impressive temperature regulation system which takes energy (calories) to maintain a consistent temperature. 

𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 heat increases metabolism between the blood and tissue, which also burns calories. ⁣
⁣
🔅The heat will make you sweat, which is your bodies natural way of flushing toxins. As your body absorbs infrared heat, water molecules begin to vibrate, which causes them to wring out impurities from the cells and release through sweat. ⁣⁣⁣

(The post Hot Yoga glow is no joke, your skin 
will be clear and rejuvenated after every class 🤩)
⁣⁣⁣
🔅The heat stress has an emotional, physical and physiological effect on the nervous system, brain and the body, making you feel like a new person when you leave class. ⁣(scroll down for more info on Heat Shock Proteins ) 
⁣
🔅𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 heat stimulates blood flow. It can help lower blood pressure, help oxygenate organs, and rid the body of toxins. ⁣
⁣
🔅𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 heat directly penetrates tissues, muscles and joints, allowing them to heal and regenerate through a combination of the increased circulation, oxygenation and detoxification.⁣

Or after class hearing the sighs of relief, the laughter, the kombucha appreciation, the new found love of cold floors and showers. ⁣

2257,"[INST] As the social media manager for the restaurant, your task is to craft a compelling weekly post for the restaurant's Facebook and Instagram pages. Here are some guidelines to follow:

Your post should align with the specified input.
Incorporate 3-5 emojis, ensuring they are spaced out throughout the post. Avoid using more than one emoji every two sentences.
Limit the mention of menu items to a maximum of 1 or 2 products.
Maintain a tone that highlights the restaurant's strengths rather than focusing on direct marketing.
Include a Call to Action (CTA) that may include opening hours, address, telephone number, or WhatsApp number if available.
Mention the restaurant's online menu, accessible at www.restaurants.menu.
Optionally, include relevant hashtags at the end of the post using the '#' symbol.

If you’ve been to the studio or one of my classes you’ll have no doubtedly heard me say the phrase ‘replenish your electrolytes 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂’ 

𝐒𝐨, 𝐰𝐡𝐲 𝐝𝐨 𝐰𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬? 

Electrolytes regulate nerve and muscle function, hydrate the body, balance blood acidity and pressure, and help rebuild damaged tissue.

When you exercise or sweat excessively you lose some of these electrolytes, mainly sodium and chloride - with potassium, magnesium and calcium in lower amounts. 

Without these electrolytes to fuel your bodily functions you will feel dehydrated, lethargic, moody and fatigued.

𝐍𝐨 𝐛𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐨. 

At hot yoga teacher training typically you are practising two very long and sweaty classes per day (sometimes three ☠️) and after 2 months of this you get very well acquainted with dehydration. 

Now not many people are doing this much yoga every day (except Martin and John during our challenge 😂) but it is still 𝐒𝐎 important to be aware of your hydration levels even if you’re coming to just one class. 

𝐃𝐞𝐡𝐲𝐝𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 means you can drink water until the cows come home but you won’t feel quenched - because your body isn’t craving water (H20) it’s craving the minerals and salts you just poured out of your body and onto your mat ! 💦 

𝐄𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐞𝐬 or a little bit of salt and lemon into your water replenishes what you lose by sweating. 🍋 It will make you feel so, so much better both in and out of the hot room. 

Remember what time you practise in the day is
crucial to understanding your hydration levels. 

𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐞 - get up early, drink water with a pinch of salt and try to skip coffee (if you can, I certainly can’t 🤫) 

𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐞 - drink 2L throughout the day, if you’ve had a lot of coffee definitely pop an electrolyte tablet in your class water bottle for that extra kick. 

Any questions : fire away!

Here at 𝐇𝐘𝐁 we heat our studio to 40° using state of the art Infrared heating panels. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
One of the benefits of infrared heat therapy is that is gently heats your muscles and joints directly instead of heating the air around you. ⁣
⁣
This creates a more comfortable atmosphere that doesn’t dry or irritate your skin - in fact your skin will be glowing after! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This along with our high humidity levels and air flow allow for optimal breathing while you’re in the room - it’s not like a dry sauna or a steam room, don’t worry.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Thanks to the infrared you will be drenched by the end ! 𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝 - 𝐬𝐨, 𝐬𝐨 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝. Sweating allows you to flush your system of toxins and free radicals, reducing bloating, water retention and blockages. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
On a deeper level there are 𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥, 𝐩𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 responses to heat therapy which are greatly beneficial to your nervous system, mental health and well-being. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Heat therapy creates heat stress which when combined with a 60 minute physical yoga class trains us in distress tolerance. This is where you 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞 and learn to breathe through  it instead of react.

You learn to find comfort in the discomfort. ⁣⁣
You learn to use your breath to slow down your heart rate and calm your nervous system. ⁣⁣
You learn emotional regulation.

 ### Input data:Menu ### Output:Our latest release: Ethiopia Chelbesa ☕️
This is a classic washed Ethiopian coffee from the Yirgacheffe region. Beans from this part of Ethiopia tend to have a very distinct, floral and fruity profile.

Neguesse Debela, who produced this coffee, runs two washing stations in Chelbesa. The coffee cherries were hand-picked by the local farmers and sold to the  stations. After that, they were hand-sorted by the staff who selected the ripe cherries from defects. Finally, the coffee pulp was removed and the cherries were ready to be processed as a washed coffee. The coffee parchments were soaked in ceramic fermentation tanks with water for 72 hours.

We are back with one of our favourite events! Held on the first Thursday of every month (across both London and Cornwall), Cupping Club is an opportunity to come and try out our latest coffees including single origin features and special editions.

 ### Input data:Menu ### Output:Our first coffee release of 2022 - San Antonio Black Honey Anaerobic☕️
This coffee continues our collaboration with one of our long-standing, direct trade partners in El Salvador, Carlos Pola. Carefully marrying modern technology with time-tested craft and intuition, Carlos and his team have an innate knowledge of the plants that grow on their cultivated hillsides surrounding Juayua. 

The coffee cherries were fermented in an anaerobic environment; then they were depulped, and laid to dry on raised beds. The 18 days of drying on the bed causes the sugar-browning caramelisation of the cherries turning them black - hence the process is called black honey.
Carlos Pola created the drying beds using strings and mesh fabric, which offers great air flow to dry coffee. Underneath, dried coffee pulp is layered up, which creates more aroma via sunlight, 'grilling' the coffee. 

The result of this careful processing is a smooth and sweet coffee, with flavour notes of raspberry, apricot and molasses.

 ### Input data:Promotions ### Output:An exciting, new release from Honduras - Tuberia ☕️

This Feature coffee comes from the Mierisch family and they chose to grow it with the unique Ethiosar varietal. As a hybrid of the Ethiopian varietal Sudan Rume and Sarchimor, its complex heritage means that there is a lot of genetic diversity in its makeup, offering a vibrant cup profile - think pomegranate, honeydew and muscovado sugar.

In coffee, a varietal (or cultivar) refers to the type of coffee plant grown. There are several variables that a producer considers when choosing which varietal to grow. Some offer a high yielding crop when harvesting, others for example produce a particular flavour profile.
The country of origin can also dictate which type of a varietal should be used too, as terroir conditions are more favourable to some - but with so much reliance on prevalent varietals, there is a greater chance of plant diseases. The Ethiosar being a combination of two other varietals, offers higher disease resistance and yields.

This coffee is named after the lively sparrows that live around the farms of Yunnan where this coffee is from. There are many regions in Yunnan that produce good coffee, but we found Menglian has always distinguished itself when cupping alongside other regions.

We are the only roaster in UK to have bought the washed version of Wa Choo and we’re loving it for its vibrant acidity and elegant cup profile, with notes of blackberry and elderflower. The natural Wa Choo has been called a 'fruit bomb' by our Head of Coffee @imfreda and it tastes of pink grapefruit, pomegranate and dark chocolate.

 ### Input data: ### Output:Many of us have set fitness/health/weight loss goals for the new year.
While there are many factors that will influence your success, one of, if not the most important is to be consistent.

3 Keys for consistency:
Training smart and not pushing so hard that you can't train the next day. Scaling appropriately to allow this.

Having a routine you can stick to each day, be it training or eating.

Lastly having fun, training with others and sharing the experience will always put a smile on your face.

So this year surround yourself with those on a similar journey.

Be part of something bigger.

Scaling:
The hang squat clean is a good opportunity to practice full hip and leg extension, and speed under the bar. Ideally, each set will be between 60-65% of your max, but newer athletes should start light and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

 ### Input data:Menu ### Output:🔥🔥🔥ATTENTION: ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP WITH MEAL PLANNING🔥🔥🔥
 
The best way to make sure you’ll eat healthy, home-cooked meals during the week is to plan them in advance.
 
We all know this, but many of us find ourselves looking at an empty fridge, overwhelmed at the thought of figuring out what to cook … then giving up and ordering takeout.
 
The only way to avoid this is to plan your meals in advance. This sounds complicated and time consuming, but the actual planning doesn’t have to take more than 20 minutes.
 
To start, sit down with two pieces of paper. On one piece of paper write down the days of the week. This is where you’ll write each night’s dinner (and lunch and breakfast if necessary). The second piece of paper will be your shopping list.
 
Next, look at your calendar and write down events — like a late meeting or a kid’s soccer game — that will interfere with dinner preparation.
 
Now it’s time to start planning your meals. Pick meals that fit your schedule, and try to get a mix of vegetables and protein during the week. If you like following recipes, get out your cookbooks or look at your favorite websites. You can collect recipes on your phone using a recipe management app. As you go through each recipe or meal, write down the ingredients you need on the shopping list. Think through every meal of the day. What do you need for snacks, lunches, and breakfast?
 
Once you’re done, take your shopping list to the grocery store. This task will be much easier when you have a list to guide you, and you won’t be tempted to throw in a bunch of unhealthy snacks “just in case.”

Where do you want to be six months from now?
 
What does your body look like and how does it perform?
 
What's your new mindset?

Just 20 minutes of exercise can improve information processing and memory function. Exercise also increases growth factors in the brain, which aids the brain in making new neural connections.
 
Feeling unfocused and forgetful? Studies have shown that people who regularly exercise have greater volume in their prefrontal cortex and medial temporal cortex, the areas of the brain that control thinking and memory.
 
Exercise also helps with mood and mental health.
 
Picking up a regular gym habit can stabilize your mood, help you sleep, and reduce stress and anxiety.

The best way to accomplish this goal is to get specific. Change “I want to get in shape” to “I will come to the gym three times a week for six months.”
 
This goal is simple and it has a clear definition of completion.
 
What’s one specific goal that will help you accomplish your overall mission?

Sometimes life gets in the way. Work, family, illness -- often a combination of all three -- can prevent you from going to the gym. Then the longer you stay away, the harder it is to return. You may feel worried you’ll be out of shape or concerned we’ll give you a hard time for being gone so long.
 
Don’t worry.
 
First, we are always happy to see you. We understand life happens, and we won’t hassle you about being gone.
 
Second, it’s likely you won’t be exactly where you were when you left. And that’s okay! The important thing is to begin, and before you know it you’ll be back where you started.
 
Here are some guidelines to follow when returning to the gym after a long hiatus:
● Start slow. Don’t overdo it on the first day. Back off on the intensity, and just get used to moving again.
● Take a rest day or two. You shouldn’t work out five days in a row on your first week back. Try coming in for three days, with a rest day in between each workout.
● Focus on stretching. Extra stretching session will help prevent tightness and keep you limber and ready for the next workout.
● Get lots of sleep. Your body needs time to recover, so go to bed early and get a good night’s sleep before each workout.
Please get in touch with us if you have any questions about returning after some time away. We will do everything we can to make your reentry process fun and easy!
